# API Design Archive

This directory contains historical API design documents from the Brainy 2.0 development process.

## Purpose
These documents represent the iterative refinement of the Brainy 2.0 API during development. They are preserved here for historical reference and to document the design decisions made along the way.

## Current API Documentation
The definitive API documentation is now located at:
- **`/docs/api/README.md`** - The ONE official API reference

## Archived Documents
These documents show the evolution of the API design:
- Various iterations of API structure
- Exploration of different naming conventions
- Refinement of the Triple Intelligence concept
- Transition from MongoDB operators to Brainy operators
- Evolution of the Neural API

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Terminology**: Vector + Graph + Metadata (not Field)
2. **Operators**: Brainy operators (greaterThan, lessThan) not MongoDB ($gt, $lt)
3. **Methods**: Specific noun/verb naming (addNoun, getNoun)
4. **Unification**: Single getNouns() method instead of multiple variants
5. **Neural API**: Complete clustering and visualization features

## Note
These documents are archived, not deleted, to preserve the development history and rationale behind API decisions.
